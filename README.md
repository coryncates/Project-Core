## Introduction

This project is an analysis of the Adult Income dataset which originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of the analysis is to predict whether income exceeds $50K per year based on census data.

## Dataset Information

The dataset has 48,842 rows and 15 attributes. These attributes include `age`, `workclass`, `fnlwgt`, `education`, `education-num`, `marital-status`, `occupation`, `relationship`, `race`, `gender`, `capital-gain`, `capital-loss`, `hours-per-week`, `native-country`, and `income`.

For more details about each attribute, please refer to the `adult.names` file in the repository.

## File List

- `adult.csv`: This is the main dataset file.
- `adult.names`: This file contains descriptions of the dataset attributes.
- `analysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the main analysis code.

## Setup and Installation

This project uses Python and Jupyter notebooks. To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook [analysis.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15vl0LZoUE2tr0g9npVOg3H6mBUtY5zVK?usp=drive_link)
```

## Usage

The Jupyter notebook `Adult Dataset.ipynb` contains the primary analysis code. You can run all the cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis, or modify the code to perform your own analysis.
